## GitHub Pages



### Host a
## project website
From any GitHub repo



### Push to
## the `gh-pages` branch
and find your content at http://username.github.io/repo



## Normally,
### `gh-pages` is an
## orphan branch



### But it doesn't have to be!



## Git submodules



### A way to
## cross-reference
### Git repos



### And they work with GitHub Pages!
