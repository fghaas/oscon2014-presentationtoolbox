A presentation
# Toolbox
That Might Blow Your Audience Away


This is about
# tools


Not
# delivery


Not
# structure


Not
# personal presence


Why? Because
# others
have covered it
# better
than I can


## Presentation Zen

## Presentation Aikido

Things you can safely
# Forget about


Microsoft
# PowerPoint


Apple
# Keynote


LibreOffice
# Impress


Google
# Slides


There is
# one tool
that you use
# every day


On your
# Laptop


on your
# Phone


on your
# Tablet


That tool is
# your browser


So you want your presentations to be in
# HTML


and look good on
# any device


Now, are you an
# HTML ninja?


or a
# CSS guru?


or a
# JavaScript expert?


Well,
# I'm not.
Far from it, actually.
